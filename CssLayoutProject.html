    <h1>Making the healthcare experience more human</h1>

    
    <div id="paragraph">
            <p>We want patients to find the perfect doctor and book 
                an appointment in the most easy way. The patient journey 
                should be enjoyable, and that's why we are always next to them: 
                to help them find the best possible care. Anytime, anywhere.</p>
            <p>
                We also help doctors to better manage their practice 
                and build their online reputation. With our integrated 
                end-to-end solution, doctors are able not only to improve 
                their online presence, but also to devote their time to what 
                really matters: their patients.
